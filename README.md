# vera-tools
z-wave tools for Veraplus created for personal use

I couldn't find a way to see a list of all Z-Wave devices in my VeraPlus network and therefore I wrote my own program that makes use of importing the http://VERAPLUS-IP:3480/data_request?id=user_data file and extracting the things I need.

## zneigh
```
Usage: zneigh -H <VERA-IP>
List all nodes in the network and show its neighbors
you can copy the output and paste into a spreadsheet
```
